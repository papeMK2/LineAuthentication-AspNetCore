# LineAuthentication for ASP.NET Core
LineAuthentication provides [LINE](https://line.me/) authentication like Twitter, Facebook, and other external login.



# How to use

It is very easy to use, just call `AddLine()` which is an extension method of `AuthenticationBuilder`. This API style is same of other external login, so you never confuse. 

```csharp
services
    .AddAuthentication()
    .AddLine(options =>
    {
        options.ClientId = Configuration["Authentication:Line:AppId"];
        options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Authentication:Line:AppSecret"];
    });
```



# Installation

```
dotnet add package LineAuthentication
```
